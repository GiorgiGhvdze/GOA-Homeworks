<p>Shift your game into high gear with the lightest Luka yet. Designed to help you create space through acceleration, the Luka 3 features full-length Cushlon 3.0 foam for a smooth heel-to-toe transition. A strong but flexible plate underfoot brings lateral containment, helping you drive out of your step-back to attack the basket. We built speed into the design as well, helping you look 100 as you blow past.</p>
