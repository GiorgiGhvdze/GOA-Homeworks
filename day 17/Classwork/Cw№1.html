        <p>The hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius; /ˌhɪpəˈpɒtəməs/; pl.: hippopotamuses), often shortened to hippo (pl.: hippos), further qualified as the common hippopotamus,
            <br>Nile hippopotamus and river hippopotamus, is a large semiaquatic mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa.
            <br>It is one of only two extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being the pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis or Hexaprotodon liberiensis).
            <br>Its name comes from the ancient Greek for "river horse" (ἱπποπόταμος).</p>

        <p>Parrots (Psittaciformes), also known as psittacines (/ˈsɪtəsaɪnz/),[1][2] are birds with a strong curved beak, upright stance, and clawed feet.
            <br>[a] They are classified in four families that contain roughly 410 species in 101 genera, found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions.
            <br>The four families are the Psittaculidae (Old World parrots), Psittacidae (African and New World parrots), Cacatuidae (cockatoos), and Strigopidae (New Zealand parrots).
            <br>One-third of all parrot species are threatened by extinction, with a higher aggregate extinction risk (IUCN Red List Index) than any other comparable bird group.
            <br>[3] Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several species inhabiting temperate regions as well.
            <br>The greatest diversity of parrots is in South America[4] and Australasia.[5]</p>

        <p>The horse (Equus ferus caballus)[2][5] is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal. It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus.
            <br>The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today.
            <br>Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE in Central Asia, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE.
            <br>Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses.
            <br>These feral populations are not true wild horses, which are horses that have never been domesticated. There is an extensive,
            <br>specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.</p>
