        <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia.
            <br>It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes.
            <br>It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two subspecies, 
            <br>mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.</p>
