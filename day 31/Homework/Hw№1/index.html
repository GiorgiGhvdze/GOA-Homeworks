    <h1 id="lion">lion</h1>
    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Sub-Saharan Africa and India.
        <br>It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail.
        <br>It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.</p>

    <h1 id="hippo">hippopotamus</h1>
    <p>The hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius; /ˌhɪpəˈpɒtəməs/; pl.: hippopotamuses), often shortened to hippo (pl.: hippos), further qualified as the common hippopotamus,
        <br>Nile hippopotamus and river hippopotamus, is a large semiaquatic mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa.
        <br>It is one of only two extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being the pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis or Hexaprotodon liberiensis).
        <br>Its name comes from the ancient Greek for "river horse" (ἱπποπόταμος).</p>

    <h1 id="parrots">parrots</h1>
    <p>Parrots (Psittaciformes), also known as psittacines (/ˈsɪtəsaɪnz/),[1][2] are birds with a strong curved beak, upright stance, and clawed feet.
        <br>[a] They are classified in four families that contain roughly 410 species in 101 genera, found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions.
        <br>The four families are the Psittaculidae (Old World parrots), Psittacidae (African and New World parrots), Cacatuidae (cockatoos), and Strigopidae (New Zealand parrots).
        <br>One-third of all parrot species are threatened by extinction, with a higher aggregate extinction risk (IUCN Red List Index) than any other comparable bird group.
        <br>[3] Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several species inhabiting temperate regions as well.
        <br>The greatest diversity of parrots is in South America[4] and Australasia.[5]</p>

    <h1 id="horse">horse</h1>
    <p>The horse (Equus ferus caballus)[2][5] is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal. It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus.
        <br>The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today.
        <br>Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE in Central Asia, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE.
        <br>Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses.
        <br>These feral populations are not true wild horses, which are horses that have never been domesticated. There is an extensive,
        <br>specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.</p>
