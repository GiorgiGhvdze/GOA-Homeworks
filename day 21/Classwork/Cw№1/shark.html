    <p>Sharks are a group of elasmobranch cartilaginous fish characterized by a ribless endoskeleton, dermal denticles, five to seven gill slits on each side, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head.
        <br> Modern sharks are classified within the division Selachii[1] and are the sister group to the Batomorphi (rays and skates).
        <br> Some sources extend the term "shark" as an informal category including extinct members of Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish) with a shark-like morphology, such as hybodonts.</p>
