    <p>Crabs are decapod crustaceans of the infraorder Brachyura (meaning "short tailed" in Greek),[a] which typically have a very short projecting tail-like abdomen, usually hidden entirely under the thorax. Their exoskeleton is often thickened and hard. They generally have five pairs of legs, and they have "pincers" or "claws" on the ends of the frontmost pair, scientifically termed the chelae. They are present in all the world's oceans, in freshwater, and on land, often hiding themselves in small crevices or burrowing into sediment. Crabs are omnivores, feeding on a variety of food, including a significant proportion of algae, as well as detritus and other invertebrates. Crabs are widely consumed by humans as food, with over 1.5 million tonnes caught annually.</p>
