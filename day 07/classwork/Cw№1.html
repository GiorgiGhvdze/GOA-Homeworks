    <h1>Lamborghini Huracán</h1>

    <img src="Lh.jpg" width="200">

    <p>The Huracán retains the 5.2-litre naturally aspirated Audi/Lamborghini 
        V10 engine of the facelifted Gallardo, tuned to generate a maximum power output of 449 kW (602 hp; 610 PS).[citation needed] To ensure its balance and performance, the car is mid-engined. The engine has both direct fuel injection and multi-point fuel injection. It combines the benefits of both of these systems; it is the first time this combination is used in a V10 engine. The firing order of the engine is 1, 6, 5, 10, 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 9. This is printed on a metal plate on the top of the engine, as with all other Lamborghini models.</p>
