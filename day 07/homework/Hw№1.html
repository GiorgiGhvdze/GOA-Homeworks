        <h3><i>Minecraft is a 2011 sandbox game developed and published by Swedish video game developer Mojang Studios. <br>Originally created by Markus "Notch" Persson using the Java programming
        language, the first public alpha build was released on 17 May 2009. <br>The game was continuously developed from then on, receiving a full release on 18 November 2011.
