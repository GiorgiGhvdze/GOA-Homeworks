        <h1><u><b><i>History</i></b></u></h1>

            <h3><i><b>

                Pepsi was first invented in 1893 as "Brad's Drink" by Caleb Bradham, who sold the drink at his drugstore in New Bern, North Carolina.

                <br>It was renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898, "Pepsi" because it was advertised to relieve dyspepsia (indigestion) and "Cola" referring to the cola flavor.
                <br>Some have also suggested that "Pepsi" may have been a reference to the drink aiding digestion like the digestive enzyme pepsin,
                <br>but pepsin itself was never used as an ingredient to Pepsi-Cola.
                
                <br>The original recipe also included sugar and vanilla.
                <br>Bradham sought to create a fountain drink that was appealing and would aid in digestion and boost energy.
