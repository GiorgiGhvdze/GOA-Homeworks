                <p>Geckos are small, mostly carnivorous lizards that have a wide distribution, found on every continent except Antarctica. Belonging to the infraorder Gekkota, geckos are found in warm climates throughout the world.
                   <br> They range from 1.6 to 60 centimetres (0.6 to 23.6 inches).
                   <br> Geckos are unique among lizards for their vocalisations, which differ from species to species. Most geckos in the family Gekkonidae use chirping or clicking sounds in their social interactions.
                   <br> Tokay geckos (Gekko gecko) are known for their loud mating calls, and some other species are capable of making hissing noises when alarmed or threatened.
                    <br>They are the most species-rich group of lizards, with about 1,500 different species worldwide.
                    <br>All geckos, except species in the family Eublepharidae lack eyelids; instead, the outer surface of the eyeball has a transparent membrane, the brille.
                    <br>They have a fixed lens within each iris that enlarges in darkness to let in more light.
                    <br>Since they cannot blink, species without eyelids generally lick their own brilles when they need to clear them of dust and dirt, in order to keep them clean and moist.[3]</p>

                <p>are reptiles of the order Testudines, characterized by a special shell developed mainly from their ribs.
                <br>Modern turtles are divided into two major groups, the Pleurodira (side necked turtles) and Cryptodira (hidden necked turtles), which differ in the way the head retracts.
                <br>There are 360 living and recently extinct species of turtles, including land-dwelling tortoises and freshwater terrapins.
                <br>They are found on most continents, some islands and, in the case of sea turtles, much of the ocean. Like other amniotes (reptiles, birds, and mammals) they breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater,
                <br>although many species live in or around water.
                <br>turtle shells are made mostly of bone; the upper part is the domed carapace, while the underside is the flatter plastron or belly-plate.
                <br>Its outer surface is covered in scales made of keratin, the material of hair, horns, and claws.
                <br>The carapace bones develop from ribs that grow sideways and develop into broad flat plates that join up to cover the body.
                <br>Turtles are ectotherms or cold-blooded, meaning that their internal temperature varies with their direct environment.
                <br>They are generally opportunistic omnivores and mainly feed on plants and animals with limited movements.
                <br>Many turtles migrate short distances seasonally. Sea turtles are the only reptiles that migrate long distances to lay their eggs on a favored beach./p>
