        <p>Halloween is thought to have influences from Christian beliefs and practices.
            <br>The English word 'Halloween' comes from "All Hallows' Eve",
            <br>being the evening before the Christian holy days of All Hallows' Day (All Saints' Day) on 1 November and All Souls' Day on 2 November.
            <br>Since the time of the early Church, major feasts in Christianity (such as Christmas, Easter and Pentecost) had vigils that began the night before, as did the feast of All Hallows.
            <br>These three days are collectively called Allhallowtide and are a time when Western Christians honour all saints and pray for recently departed souls who have yet to reach Heaven.
            <br>Commemorations of all saints and martyrs were held by several churches on various dates, mostly in springtime.
            <br>In 4th-century Roman Edessa it was held on 13 May, and on 13 May 609, Pope Boniface IV re-dedicated the Pantheon in Rome to "St Mary and all martyrs".
            <br>This was the date of Lemuria, an ancient Roman festival of the dead.</p>
